# Dataset Card for SoccerWiki

<!-- Provide a quick summary of the dataset. -->

This repository contains the database for paper **"Multi-Agent System for Comprehensive Soccer Understanding"** in [ACM Multimidia 2025](https://acmmm2025.org/).

**SoccerWiki** is a large-scale multimodal soccer knowledge base. The dataset integrates rich domain knowledge about soccer players, teams, referees, and venues, which is used to facilitate knowledge-driven reasoning and decision-making in various soccer-related tasks.

This dataset was built using data from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) and [Flashscore](https://www.flashscore.com/), and includes detailed attributes and images for each entity. It consists of 9,471 players, 266 teams, 202 referees, and 235 venues, making it one of the most comprehensive resources for soccer-related information.
